White Rabbit is a web application aimed at helping students plan for their projects. It does this by recommending a personalized due date based on the student’s pace and project choice.

The name “White Rabbit” is inspired by a character in Lewis Caroll’s “Alice's Adventures in Wonderland”. White Rabbit always carries a watch and is constantly concerned with being late.

“Oh my ears and whiskers! I'm late, I'm late I'm late!” - White Rabbit
